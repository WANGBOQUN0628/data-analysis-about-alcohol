# data-analysis-about-alcohol
### Project Description

You will group, summarize, and visualize data on breath alcohol tests in Ames, Iowa, (home of Iowa State University) from 2013-2017. Some questions you will answer include, "What is the highest recorded value?" and "When do breath alcohol tests occur most?"

Open the **notebook.ipynb** to see details.

To repeat this work on your own computer, please download the cvs files and put them in a folder called **datasets** and put this folder together with **notebook.ipynb** in another folder.
